<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">Am I covered as soon as I join?</h2>
    <p>
        No. Cover begins 90 days after the day you deposit your R100 into the ZPC account
    </p>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">How many dependants can I put on my form?</h2>
    <p>
        At the moment ZPC only covers the principal member, ONE spouse, and biological children. You will
        be asked to produce a birth certificate on the death of your child for verification that it is your child.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">Do I pay any subscriptions?</h2>
    <p>
        You are required to pay R100 only at the death of a fully covered member. If there is no death in the
        community you do not pay anything.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">Who is a fully covered member?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Any person whose membership is more than 90 days.</li>
        <li>A member who has not skipped any payment obligation at the time the member needs cover.</li>
        <li>A member’s spouse and children between 4 months and 1 day before they turn 21 years.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">Is my child under 21 who is married or stays with someone as husband and wife covered?</h2>
    <p>No. They need to join as an independent family of their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">Does my child who turns 21 or gets married have to wait 90 days to become fully covered?</h2>
    <p>
        If they inform the committee and the committee verifies that they were dependant on an existing
        membership their cover starts 24 hours after they deposit their joining fee.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">When is my membership terminated?</h2>
    <p>
        Membership is automatically terminated the moment a member becomes in arrears. ZPC no longer
        accepts late payment to avoid building up a big bank balance.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will remain a member as long as you remain in South Africa.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">What happens if I leave South Africa?</h2>
    <p>

    <h2 class="align-content-center">What do I do if my spouse or dependant dies?</h2>
    <p>

<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">What happens after I contact them?</h2>
    <p>
        A verification process begins and takes between 1hrs and 48hrs.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">What happens when verification is complete?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The committee will inform the community that there is a funeral. In consultation with the next
            of kin and the family of the deceased an amount of R5000 is transferred from the ZPC STOKVEL
            account into the account that the beneficiary would have chosen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Members are given 5 days to deposit their R100 funeral contribution into the ZPC STOKVEL
            account.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the 6th day or any other day as directed by the beneficiaries the FULL amount, minus the
            R5000 given after verification, will be transferred to the beneficiary’s chosen bank account.
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h2 class="align-content-center">
        What happens if beneficiary family is not in agreement on whose account to transfer
        money to?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Under normal circumstances the committee works with the person listed as the next of kin. It is
        advised that members who are married list their spouses as their next of kin. This removes the
        confusion that may arise where the spouse and the next of kin are two different people and each
        one of them is giving a different direction on where the money should be transferred to.
