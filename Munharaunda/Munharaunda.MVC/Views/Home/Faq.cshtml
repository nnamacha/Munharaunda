    <h6 class="text-center">How many dependants can I put on my form?</h6>
    <p>
        At the moment ZPC only covers the principal member, ONE spouse, and biological children. You will
        be asked to produce a birth certificate on the death of your child for verification that it is your child.

<div class="align-content-between">
    <h6 class="text-center">Do I pay any subscriptions?</h6>
    <p>
        You are required to pay R100 only at the death of a fully covered member. If there is no death in the
        community you do not pay anything.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="align-content-between">
    <h6 class="text-center">Who is a fully covered member?</h6>

<div class="align-content-between">
    <h6 class="text-center">What happens when verification is complete?</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The committee will inform the community that there is a funeral. In consultation with the next
            of kin and the family of the deceased an amount of R5000 is transferred from the ZPC STOKVEL
            account into the account that the beneficiary would have chosen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Members are given 5 days to deposit their R100 funeral contribution into the ZPC STOKVEL
            account.
        </li>
        <li>
            On the 6th day or any other day as directed by the beneficiaries the FULL amount, minus the
            R5000 given after verification, will be transferred to the beneficiary’s chosen bank account.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h6 class="text-center">
        What happens if beneficiary family is not in agreement on whose account to transfer
        money to?
    </h6>
    <p>
        Under normal circumstances the committee works with the person listed as the next of kin. It is
        advised that members who are married list their spouses as their next of kin. This removes the
        confusion that may arise where the spouse and the next of kin are two different people and each
        one of them is giving a different direction on where the money should be transferred to.
